# foodster

It is a Flutter project. The app was created to solve the problem that people generally can't find food to cook or don't know how to cook.

## About the project

The most important feature of the application is that it can randomly suggest recipes to users. In addition, users can create a recipe favorite list with the accounts they create, and with this favorite list, they can keep the recipes they like and make in their favorite lists.

Users can also search for recipes from the database and specify which toppings are included or not.

Users can also share their favorite recipes with their friends with the "Share" button.
